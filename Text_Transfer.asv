%onto a picture of a waterfall.

% Loading the images
movieScene = imread("IMG_001.png");
waterfall = imread("IMG_002.jpg");

%Greyscale & Contrast Adjustment 
movieSceneGray = im2gray(movieScene);
movieSceneAdjust = imadjust(movieSceneGray);

%Spatial Filtering
avg_filter = fspecial("average",4);
movieSceneSmooth = imfilter(movieSceneAdjust, avg_filter);
